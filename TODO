= svMisc To Do list

* For install(), allow to specify the list of packages in ..., but how to
  specify installation arguments then? Also, allows to specify from where to
  install the packages (github, etc. should be also accepted).

* A function derived from import::from(), but that populates
  .packages_to_install; idem for '::', ':::', library() and require().

* A liste of (remote) sources for packages to install from github, bitbucket,
  etc. + a list of dependencies and code to run to install these.

* Finalize the actions management

* Specification of dates in RJSON format

* Write the code in objList() to list content inside objects, and perhaps also
  objects attributes.

* Rework mechanism to call .guiCmd() from objXXX() functions

* Make indeterminate progress()ion

* Use this in call tips to get the call for S3 method for given objects
args(getS3method("predict", class(myobj), optional = TRUE)). + selectMethod
for S4 object does the same thing!

* objMenu(): add copy name to clipboard, send name to editor in menu

* Use RShowDoc() to access further R documentation.

* Update po file.

* Write a complete battery of tests for this package.
